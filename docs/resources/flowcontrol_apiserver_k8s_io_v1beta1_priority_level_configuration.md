## metadata

`metadata` is the standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

    
#### annotations

######  TypeMap

Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations
#### creation_timestamp

######  ReadOnly • TypeString

CreationTimestamp is a timestamp representing the server time when this object was created. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before order across separate operations. Clients may not set this value. It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC.

Populated by the system. Read-only. Null for lists. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata
#### deletion_grace_period_seconds

######  ReadOnly • TypeInt

Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only.
#### deletion_timestamp

######  ReadOnly • TypeString

DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata
#### labels

######  TypeMap

Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels
#### name

######  TypeString

Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names
#### namespace

######  TypeString

Namespace defines the space within which each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.

Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces
#### resource_version

######  ReadOnly • TypeString

An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these values as opaque and passed unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular resource or set of resources.

Populated by the system. Read-only. Value must be treated as opaque by clients and . More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency
#### self_link

######  ReadOnly • TypeString

SelfLink is a URL representing this object. Populated by the system. Read-only.

DEPRECATED Kubernetes will stop propagating this field in 1.20 release and the field is planned to be removed in 1.21 release.
#### uid

######  ReadOnly • TypeString

UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT operations.

Populated by the system. Read-only. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids
## spec

`spec` is the specification of the desired behavior of a "request-priority". More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status

    
## limited

`limited` specifies how requests are handled for a Limited priority level. This field must be non-empty if and only if `type` is `"Limited"`.

    
#### assured_concurrency_shares

######  TypeInt

`assuredConcurrencyShares` (ACS) configures the execution limit, which is a limit on the number of requests of this priority level that may be exeucting at a given time.  ACS must be a positive number. The server's concurrency limit (SCL) is divided among the concurrency-controlled priority levels in proportion to their assured concurrency shares. This produces the assured concurrency value (ACV) --- the number of requests that may be executing at a time --- for each such priority level:

            ACV(l) = ceil( SCL * ACS(l) / ( sum[priority levels k] ACS(k) ) )

bigger numbers of ACS mean more reserved concurrent requests (at the expense of every other PL). This field has a default value of 30.
## limit_response

`limitResponse` indicates what to do with requests that can not be executed right now

    
## queuing

`queuing` holds the configuration parameters for queuing. This field may be non-empty only if `type` is `"Queue"`.

    
#### hand_size

######  TypeInt

`handSize` is a small positive number that configures the shuffle sharding of requests into queues.  When enqueuing a request at this priority level the request's flow identifier (a string pair) is hashed and the hash value is used to shuffle the list of queues and deal a hand of the size specified here.  The request is put into one of the shortest queues in that hand. `handSize` must be no larger than `queues`, and should be significantly smaller (so that a few heavy flows do not saturate most of the queues).  See the user-facing documentation for more extensive guidance on setting this field.  This field has a default value of 8.
#### queue_length_limit

######  TypeInt

`queueLengthLimit` is the maximum number of requests allowed to be waiting in a given queue of this priority level at a time; excess requests are rejected.  This value must be positive.  If not specified, it will be defaulted to 50.
#### queues

######  TypeInt

`queues` is the number of queues for this priority level. The queues exist independently at each apiserver. The value must be positive.  Setting it to 1 effectively precludes shufflesharding and thus makes the distinguisher method of associated flow schemas irrelevant.  This field has a default value of 64.
#### type

###### Required •  TypeString

`type` is "Queue" or "Reject". "Queue" means that requests that can not be executed upon arrival are held in a queue until they can be executed or a queuing limit is reached. "Reject" means that requests that can not be executed upon arrival are rejected. Required.
#### type

###### Required •  TypeString

`type` indicates whether this priority level is subject to limitation on request execution.  A value of `"Exempt"` means that requests of this priority level are not subject to a limit (and thus are never queued) and do not detract from the capacity made available to other priority levels.  A value of `"Limited"` means that (a) requests of this priority level _are_ subject to limits and (b) some of the server's limited capacity is made available exclusively to this priority level. Required.
