# resource "k8s_storage_k8s_io_v1_csi_driver"

CSIDriver captures information about a Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume driver deployed on the cluster. Kubernetes attach detach controller uses this object to determine whether attach is required. Kubelet uses this object to determine whether pod information needs to be passed on mount. CSIDriver objects are non-namespaced.

## metadata

Standard object metadata. metadata.Name indicates the name of the CSI driver that this object refers to; it MUST be the same name returned by the CSI GetPluginName() call for that driver. The driver name must be 63 characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9A-Z]) with dashes (-), dots (.), and alphanumerics between. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

    
#### annotations

######  TypeMap

Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations
#### creation_timestamp

######  ReadOnly • TypeString

CreationTimestamp is a timestamp representing the server time when this object was created. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before order across separate operations. Clients may not set this value. It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC.

Populated by the system. Read-only. Null for lists. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata
#### deletion_grace_period_seconds

######  ReadOnly • TypeInt

Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only.
#### deletion_timestamp

######  ReadOnly • TypeString

DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata
#### labels

######  TypeMap

Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels
#### name

######  TypeString

Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names
#### namespace

######  TypeString

Namespace defines the space within which each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.

Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces
#### resource_version

######  ReadOnly • TypeString

An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these values as opaque and passed unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular resource or set of resources.

Populated by the system. Read-only. Value must be treated as opaque by clients and . More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency
#### self_link

######  ReadOnly • TypeString

SelfLink is a URL representing this object. Populated by the system. Read-only.

DEPRECATED Kubernetes will stop propagating this field in 1.20 release and the field is planned to be removed in 1.21 release.
#### uid

######  ReadOnly • TypeString

UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT operations.

Populated by the system. Read-only. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids
## spec

Specification of the CSI Driver.

    
#### attach_required

######  TypeString

attachRequired indicates this CSI volume driver requires an attach operation (because it implements the CSI ControllerPublishVolume() method), and that the Kubernetes attach detach controller should call the attach volume interface which checks the volumeattachment status and waits until the volume is attached before proceeding to mounting. The CSI external-attacher coordinates with CSI volume driver and updates the volumeattachment status when the attach operation is complete. If the CSIDriverRegistry feature gate is enabled and the value is specified to false, the attach operation will be skipped. Otherwise the attach operation will be called.

This field is immutable.
#### fsgroup_policy

######  TypeString

Defines if the underlying volume supports changing ownership and permission of the volume before being mounted. Refer to the specific FSGroupPolicy values for additional details. This field is alpha-level, and is only honored by servers that enable the CSIVolumeFSGroupPolicy feature gate.

This field is immutable.
#### pod_info_onmount

######  TypeString

If set to true, podInfoOnMount indicates this CSI volume driver requires additional pod information (like podName, podUID, etc.) during mount operations. If set to false, pod information will not be passed on mount. Default is false. The CSI driver specifies podInfoOnMount as part of driver deployment. If true, Kubelet will pass pod information as VolumeContext in the CSI NodePublishVolume() calls. The CSI driver is responsible for parsing and validating the information passed in as VolumeContext. The following VolumeConext will be passed if podInfoOnMount is set to true. This list might grow, but the prefix will be used. "csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.name": pod.Name "csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.namespace": pod.Namespace "csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.uid": string(pod.UID) "csi.storage.k8s.io/ephemeral": "true" if the volume is an ephemeral inline volume
                                defined by a CSIVolumeSource, otherwise "false"

"csi.storage.k8s.io/ephemeral" is a new feature in Kubernetes 1.16. It is only required for drivers which support both the "Persistent" and "Ephemeral" VolumeLifecycleMode. Other drivers can leave pod info disabled and/or ignore this field. As Kubernetes 1.15 doesn't support this field, drivers can only support one mode when deployed on such a cluster and the deployment determines which mode that is, for example via a command line parameter of the driver.

This field is immutable.
#### requires_republish

######  TypeString

RequiresRepublish indicates the CSI driver wants `NodePublishVolume` being periodically called to reflect any possible change in the mounted volume. This field defaults to false.

Note: After a successful initial NodePublishVolume call, subsequent calls to NodePublishVolume should only update the contents of the volume. New mount points will not be seen by a running container.

This is a beta feature and only available when the CSIServiceAccountToken feature is enabled.
#### storage_capacity

######  TypeString

If set to true, storageCapacity indicates that the CSI volume driver wants pod scheduling to consider the storage capacity that the driver deployment will report by creating CSIStorageCapacity objects with capacity information.

The check can be enabled immediately when deploying a driver. In that case, provisioning new volumes with late binding will pause until the driver deployment has published some suitable CSIStorageCapacity object.

Alternatively, the driver can be deployed with the field unset or false and it can be flipped later when storage capacity information has been published.

This field is immutable.

This is a beta field and only available when the CSIStorageCapacity feature is enabled. The default is false.
## token_requests

TokenRequests indicates the CSI driver needs pods' service account tokens it is mounting volume for to do necessary authentication. Kubelet will pass the tokens in VolumeContext in the CSI NodePublishVolume calls. The CSI driver should parse and validate the following VolumeContext: "csi.storage.k8s.io/serviceAccount.tokens": {
  "<audience>": {
    "token": <token>,
    "expirationTimestamp": <expiration timestamp in RFC3339>,
  },
  ...
}

Note: Audience in each TokenRequest should be different and at most one token is empty string. To receive a new token after expiry, RequiresRepublish can be used to trigger NodePublishVolume periodically.

This is a beta feature and only available when the CSIServiceAccountToken feature is enabled.

    
#### audience

###### Required •  TypeString

Audience is the intended audience of the token in "TokenRequestSpec". It will default to the audiences of kube apiserver.
#### expiration_seconds

######  TypeInt

ExpirationSeconds is the duration of validity of the token in "TokenRequestSpec". It has the same default value of "ExpirationSeconds" in "TokenRequestSpec".
#### volume_lifecycle_modes

######  TypeList

volumeLifecycleModes defines what kind of volumes this CSI volume driver supports. The default if the list is empty is "Persistent", which is the usage defined by the CSI specification and implemented in Kubernetes via the usual PV/PVC mechanism. The other mode is "Ephemeral". In this mode, volumes are defined inline inside the pod spec with CSIVolumeSource and their lifecycle is tied to the lifecycle of that pod. A driver has to be aware of this because it is only going to get a NodePublishVolume call for such a volume. For more information about implementing this mode, see https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/ephemeral-local-volumes.html A driver can support one or more of these modes and more modes may be added in the future. This field is beta.

This field is immutable.
